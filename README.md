# SQLite
SQLite Project using DBBrowser &amp; Python


In this project, you can access the SQL codes I wrote in JupyterLab for the queiries from the database I created using DBBrowser.

Basic queries, join operations, some analysis by combining SQLite and pandas commands, and my answers to some practice questions are included in the project content.
